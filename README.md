# Boas 👋

I'm Rui Pires, a portuguese college student looking for constant creative expression.
- 🗺️ I'm currently diving into procedural generation and roguelike development
- 🔊 I'm looking forward to learning DSP and audio plugin development
- 🔍 Other programming interests include language processing, software development and systems programming
- 📖 I'm always eager to learn and challenge myself
- 🎸 I'm also a big music fan and a musician, yet to record anything worth listening to
- 🎹 As a musician, I'm mostly interested prog rock/metal, jazz fusion, classical music and game/movie soundtracks
- 🥁 I play the drums, guitar, bass, piano and synth. I also enjoy orchestra composition and I'm learning music production
